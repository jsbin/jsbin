# Two second set up

1. Install [node](http://nodejs.org)
2. From your Terminal (or [command prompt](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/command-prompt-windows-8.htm) if you're on Windows) run:

```
    $ npm install -g jsbin
    $ jsbin
```
    
**Note:** You may have to run npm as the super user, in which case the first command would be:

    $ sudo npm install -g jsbin

If you run the command as super user, you might be prompted for your password.
